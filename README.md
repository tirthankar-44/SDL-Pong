# SDL-Pong

A very simple version of the Pong game created by me in the process of learning to use the SDL Library, as an attempt to learn Game Development. 

Both paddles can be controlled separately: move the left paddle up and down using the `W` and `S` keys, and move the right paddle using `Up` and `Down` arrow keys. Quitting the program can be done using the Close button or `Esc` key.

Below is a snapshot of the program:
